    <h1>Pizza</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza is a crowd-pleasing choice for busy weeknights and fun weekend dinners alike.</p>
    <p>you don't have to rely on restaurants or takeout for top-notch pizza.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Water </li>
        <li>3 Eggs</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Yeast</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine 1 cup (125g) of flour, instant yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl.
             If desired, add garlic powder and dried basil at this point as well.</li>
        <li>Add olive oil and warm water and use a wooden spoon to stir well very well.</li>
        <li>Gradually add another 1 cup (125g) of flour. Add any additional flour as needed
            (I've found that sometimes I need as much as an additional â…“ cup), stirring until
            the dough is forming into a cohesive, elastic ball and is beginning to pull away
            from the sides of the bowl (see video above recipe for visual cue). The dough will
             still be slightly sticky but still should be manageable with your hands.</li>
    </ol>
